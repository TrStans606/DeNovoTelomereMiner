# DeNovoTelomereMiner Quick Start

DeNovoTelomereMiner is built for POSIX systems and has been tested on Fedora, Ubuntu, and macOS 15. For an easy install try the new [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) option which works on Linux, macOS (Intel and ARM), and Windows. For Windows users, try [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) offered by Microsoft. It has been tested on Python version 13.1. It is recommended to install dependencies via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/), both of which are package managers on macOS and Linux. Instructions for installation are included on the projectâ€™s homepages.

## Docker instructions for Linux, macOS and Windows
1. Run this build command in terminal (macOS and Linux) or PowerShell (Windows):

```shell
docker build -t denovo_telomere_miner .
```

2. Activate the Docker image with the command:

```shell
docker run -it denovo_telomere_miner bash
```
3. Run the shell script inside the new container enviroment:

```shell
bash install.sh
```

It's that simple! Now the teloport environment is set up perfectly for running. To copy your data from your host machine to the docker image use this command on your host machine:
```shell
docker cp <any file or directory> denovo_telomere_miner:DeNovoTelomereMiner
```
The image also comes equiped with wget and the NCBI sra-toolkit to easily add data from FTP servers or the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) directly from the container itself.
