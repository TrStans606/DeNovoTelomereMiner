/* Check sequence to see if it is a telomeric read.
 * First seek a telomere repeat. For forward repeats, this is the last repeat within the interval [start, stop].
 *  For reverse complement repeats, this is the first repeat within the interval [0, sequence.length() - start].
 *  This is because for reverse complement repeats, sequence quality drops drastically toward the end of the read,
 *      so we'd prefer to match earlier in the read.
 *  Also for reverse complement reads, we will try more matches of the telRepeat if they occur, to check for potential
 *      telomeres. This is to account for potentially having a random centrally-occurring telomere repeat in the read.
