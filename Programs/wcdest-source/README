Readme for the wcd distribution


wcd (pronounced "wicked") is a d2-clustering program 
released under the GNU Public Licence.


The distribution should consists of 

  wcd.c -- the program
  wcd.texi -- source of help file
  README   -- this file
  Makefile


To create documenation
   make pdf
   make info
   make html

etc, depending on what sort of document you want.

Use the info system to get information

info -f wcd


To compile say
   ./configure
   make

Please note that under early versions of FreeBSD you may have to make a small change
in wcd.h in line 8. This is commented.


NB: This version of the distribution was written for gcc assuming that
all the gcc libraries are in the standard (i.e. where RedHat puts
them) places. This is a problem in some distributions. The main
problem is that some C libraries don't support long options. If this
is the case for your distribution of C (and you can find out by
running
  make wcd 
and seeing if there are any complaints. If there , change the makefile
so that it reads  

      CFLAGS = -DNOLONGOPT -O2
